            <p>
                The data used for Missing Tracks comes from the UKMPU (UK Missing Persons Unit) <a
                    href="http://missingpersons.police.uk/en-gb/resources/downloads/missing-persons-statistical-bulletins"
                    target="_blank">2016-2017 report</a>. This statistical bulletin outlines the extent and nature of
                reports made to British Police on an annual basis. As explained in their website, police forces in
                England and Wales are required to share this data as part of the 2009 Code of Practice on the Collection
                of Missing Persons Data.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2016-2017 report was the first one published accompanied with a file with the underlying data,
                rather than as appendices to the report. According to the UKMPU, this approach “allows a greater set of
                data to be released allowing those interested to explore in more detail the data supplied by UK Police”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The report provides key statistical data regarding missing people and unidentified individuals reported
                to UK police in the financial year 2016-17. A missing person is defined as:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                “Anyone whose whereabouts cannot be established will be considered as missing until they have been
                located, and their well-being or otherwise confirmed”
                <p>
                    <cite>(UKMPU 2016-17 Data Report)</cite>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Prior to this, there was a distinction between a missing person and an absent person (no apparent risk),
                a revision of the definition that was introduced in January 2017. Since then, all reports were to be
                classified as missing. However, since this change was introduced late in the reporting year, <b>the
                    2016-17
                    publication still distinguishes between missing and absent reports.</b> The adoption of the revised
                definition has varied across different police forces, therefore this should be taken in mind when
                comparing the data between different forces and previous years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the data from <b>Scotland and Northern Ireland</b> has been left out of this analysis for
                two reasons:
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Scotland and Northern Ireland record data for missing persons in a different way than in England
                        and Wales. This is also the first year in which Northern Ireland has been able to provide data
                        to include in the report.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scotland and Northern Ireland don’t drill down in as much detail as England and Wales.
                        Therefore, in the articles in Missing Tracks the readers won’t find as many references to
                        Scotland and Northern Ireland apart from general figures.

                    statistic</a> that opens the article ‘Britain’s Missing’ comes from the independent organization
                Missing People. The first map, <b>‘Missing related calls by police forces’</b>, was made using the table
                B2
                (‘Number of missing incidents and individuals recorded by UK police forces 2016-17’) of the UKMPU

                    <li>
                        The data from Avon and Somerset includes both absent and missing cases as the force cannot
                        distinguish between the two.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The adult data for Lincolnshire only includes certain data from July 2016-March 2017 as it is
                        not possible to distinguish between missing and absent data.

                    <li>
                        Note as well that the highest rate happens in the City of London (15.4), which is not visible if
                        you don’t zoom in the map. You can zoom in the Metropolitan Police Service to see this. The City
                        has a resident population of 9,401 (ONS estimate, mid-2016).

                The second chart, <b>‘Age and gender distribution of missing incidents’</b>, was made using the table C4
                of the
                UKMPU Missing Person’s Report 2016-17 report. Some considerations about this chart:

                        The data from Avon and Somerset includes both absent and missing cases as the force cannot

            <p>
                The fourth chart, <b>‘Number of calls recorded regarding missing incidents’</b>, was made using the
                table A1 of
                the UKMPU Missing Person’s Report 2016-17. Some considerations about this chart:

                    <li>
                        In 2011/12 and 2012/13, the call figure was reported as the incident figure. In 2013/14 a change
                        in terminology was made due to better understanding of the data being received.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The total increase in calls recorded has been calculated removing Dorset Police figures as the
                        force was unable to provide data for 2015/16 due to a change in IT system part way through the
                        year.

                For this section the data from the UKMPU Missing Person’s Report 2016-2017 was filtered in order to show
                only the data specific to young people under the age of 18. In this data a child is considered to be
                anyone under the age of 18 at the time they went missing.

            <p>
                It’s important to note that the data is likely to be an underestimate of the real figure. Some police
                forces also record data differently. In the instance of gender-related data there are a number of cases
                where the gender of the child is unknown. The data from Avon and Somerset includes both absent and
                missing cases as the force cannot distinguish between the two.

                Why are they missing?
            </p>
            <p>
                The data about reasons for missing incidents used in this section was published in the table E4 of UKMPU
                Missing Person’s Report 2016-2017. They were collected from the closure reports completed by an officer
                when a person is found. That means there may be other persons who went missing and have not been found,
                and we cannot know the reasons for missing incidents from these persons. Moreover, among 106,212
                incidents in which missing persons have been found, there are only 59,487 incidents (or 56 %) in which
                the reasons for missing can be identified. We do not know the reasons for other remaining incidents as
                well.
            </p>
            <p>
                All percentage values used in the article relate to the proportion of closure reports in that age range
                or that group of age ranges with the specified reason for missing endorsed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another point worth noting is, not all police forces provided this data. There are only 21 police forces
                in England and Wales, which are using a missing persons case management system named ‘COMPACT’, that
                supplied them. These police forces are Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, Devon and Cornwall,
                Dyfed-Powys, Essex, Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire, Humberside, Kent, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire,
                Merseyside, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Suffolk, Sussex, Warwickshire and
                West Mercia, West Midlands.

                    figure</a> included in the article ‘How can we find them?’ comes from the independent organization
                Missing People. The first chart, <b>‘Duration of missing incidents’</b>, was made using the table E5 of
                the
                UKMPU Missing Person’s Report (2016-17). Some considerations about this chart:

                    <li>
                        This data reflects the time lapsed from when the person was reported missing to the police to
                        when the person was found. It does not include unresolved incidents.

                        The Metropolitan Police and Northumbria do not have the option to indicate if a person was found
